<h4 align="justify">Node-RED is a powerful, open-source flow-based development tool for visual programming. It is primarily used for wiring together devices, APIs, and online services in new and interesting ways. Developed by IBM, it provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using a wide range of nodes. Node-RED is especially popular in IoT and home automation projects for its ease of use and integration capabilities.</h4>
